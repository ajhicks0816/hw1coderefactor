## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to refactor the exisiting site provided and make it more web accessible.

## Challenges
As a new developer I intially struggled with a starting point for this project. I did a lot of research to try to get a better understanding of semantic elements, their meanings and how they worked within a HTML file. Another challenge was working with the starter HTML code provided and working within the CSS file to combine and eliminate as much excess as possible.
