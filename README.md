# hw1coderefactor

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to refactor the exisiting site provided and make it more web accessible.

## Challenges
As a new/future developer I intially struggled with a starting point for this project. I researched to get a better understanding of semantic elements, their meanings and how they worked within a HTML file. Another challenge was working with the starter HTML code provided and working within the CSS file to combine and eliminate as much excess as possible.

## Motivation
My ah ha moment came when I fixed one of the links within the site. This pushed me forward (after a 3 hour stall) within the project. I started taking small steps and continued building to work within the file. I began to trust my gut and go with the things that I knew were familiar but was too scared to try out of fear of messing up the entire code provided. This is the first of many projects that will continue to build my confidence in this career field. These kinds of projects are vital to help get a better understanding of how things work.
